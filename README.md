# Co-Co-ESPRIT: Platform for Carpooling, Colocation, and ESPRIT Club Events

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: Angular, HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java JDK
- **Database**: MySQL
- **APIs**: PayPal API (reservations), SMS API (notifications), OpenWeather API (weather forecasts)
- **Testing and Documentation**: Postman, Swagger
- **Development Process**: Agile Scrum

## Project Description:

Co-Co-ESPRIT is a platform that simplifies carpooling, colocation (shared housing), and participation in ESPRIT club events. Built with **Angular** on the frontend and **Spring Boot** on the backend, the platform enhances student life by providing seamless access to transportation options, housing opportunities, and event participation.

The platform integrates several external APIs, including PayPal for secure payments, SMS for notifications, and OpenWeather for real-time weather updates for events.

## Key Features:

- **Carpooling:**
  - **Post a Ride**: Students can create ride listings with details like destination, date, and type (daily or one-time).
  - **Search for Rides**: Students can search for available rides based on filters such as destination, time, and ride type.

- **Colocation (Shared Housing):**
  - **Post Housing**: Users can post available shared housing opportunities.
  - **Search for Housing**: Students can browse and find shared accommodation options based on their preferences.

- **Event Management:**
  - **Post Events**: ESPRIT clubs can create events with details like date, time, and location.
  - **Reserve Spots**: Students can reserve spots for events via PayPal, and receive SMS confirmations.
  - **Weather Updates**: The weather for event dates is shown in real-time via OpenWeather integration.

- **Feedback & Reactions:**
  - After events, students can provide feedback through reactions (happy, neutral, angry) or comments.
  - Administrators can view feedback statistics and insights into event popularity.

## How It Works:

1. **Carpooling:**
   - Drivers post ride details, and students search for rides based on their preferences.
   - The system provides real-time feedback on ride availability.

2. **Colocation:**
   - Students can browse available shared accommodations or post new listings.
   - Iterative improvements based on user feedback ensure ease of use.

3. **Event Participation:**
   - Clubs create events, and students can sign up for them.
   - After payment through PayPal, an SMS confirmation is sent to the student.
   - The system provides weather updates for the event date, helping students make informed decisions.

4. **Admin Feedback Management:**
   - Administrators can view and manage event feedback, offering insights for future improvements.

## Technologies and Tools Used:

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Payment Integration**: PayPal
- **Notifications**: SMS API
- **Weather Integration**: OpenWeather API
- **Version Control**: GitHub
